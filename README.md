# Employee-Attrition-Prediction

Link: https://employee-attrition-model.streamlit.app/

This project aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques, the project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to accurately predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization.

## Features
- *Data Preprocessing:* Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- *Feature Engineering:* Creating new features that might help in improving the model performance.
- *Model Training:* Implementing various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- *Model Evaluation:* Comparing models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
